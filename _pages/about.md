## &#x270d; the dark side of being just me
Hey...Dear friends...Welcome 😍 I am Meysam. An INFJ personality type. Yeah! got the idea? What is wrong with me? 🤷🏻 I mean an idealist that has a dream of doing big works, you know, not that big, but very very big! Cry me a river! And my problem is this imperfect world. Hopefully maybe someday I would make some contributions and help.Actually this qoute is very inspring for me "To go forward you have to leave something behind". I remember that from an emotional scene from Interstellar movie which I think offer the Newton's first law. Anyway, I love that statement.

## &#x270d; another piece of me
Wait a moment! If you are interested in intelligent systems, maytbe you find anything new or innovative in my posts that can help you. My major is Business Intelligence(BI). I have an enthusiasm about data-driven intelligent systems. Yes! Systrms that fed by data and AI algorithms to demonstrate extraaaa...wait for it... ordinary capabilities/features.
